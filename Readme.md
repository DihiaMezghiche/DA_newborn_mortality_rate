# Newborn mortality rate
This project is a data analysis project in which i will analyze 4 sets of data provided by [Gapminder world](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)

## Installation
To execute this project you will need the following python librairies:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv
I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all the necessary packages, and the IPython notebook.

## Introduction

This readme describes the whole process of data analysis from data gathering to sharing my results. 
Through this project i learned what follows: 
* All the steps of a usual data analysis process.
* Ho to be comfortable asking answerable questions about a given set of data, and then answering those questions.
* How to investigate problems in a dataset and collate the data into a format i can use.
* Have sufficient experience to communicate the results of my analysis.
* Be able to use vector operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code.
* Familiarize myself with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which allows me to access your data more easily.
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce graphs illustrating my results.

Through out this project i followed the following steps: 
1. I gathered my data from [Gapminder world](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
2. I Organized my project files
3. Ask the questions that I will answer by analyzing the data
4. Share your findings.

 ## Dataset sources
**Data set 1 : births attended by skilled health staff percent of total**
 * Description : a database that shows the percentage of births attended by skilled health personnel.
**Data set 2 : females aged 15plus employment rate percen**
 * Description : Percentage of the female population, age group 15+, who were employed in the given year.
**Data set 3 :  Maternal mortality ratio**
**Data set 4 : females aged 15plus employment rate percen**
 * Description : Children who died in the first 28 days per 1000 live births.
 
  ## Data Wrangling
 First i extracted from each dataset the data that i needn, during this project i only needed the data from 2005 to 2015 afterwards i noticed that my data was not well organized so i did what is called "Tidy the data" and deleted the missing values.
 
 ## My Findings
 In conclusion, what I can conclude from this study is: 
 * Natal mortality rate may be related to the rates of supervised birth. with more data this could be confirmed. 
 * The birth mortality rate is closely related to the maternal mortality rate. 
 * Whether women work or not does not affect the mortality rate.
