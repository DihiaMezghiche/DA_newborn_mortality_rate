# Newborn mortality rate
This project is a data analysis project in which i will analyze 4 sets of data provided by [Gapminder world](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)

## Installation
To execute this project you will need the following python librairies:
* pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* csv
I recommend installing Anaconda, which comes with all the necessary packages, and the IPython notebook.

# Introduction

This readme describes the whole process of data analysis from data gathering to sharing my results. 
Through this project i learned what follows: 
* All the steps of a usual data analysis process.
* Ho to be comfortable asking answerable questions about a given set of data, and then answering those questions.
* How to investigate problems in a dataset and collate the data into a format i can use.
* Have sufficient experience to communicate the results of my analysis.
* Be able to use vector operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up my data analysis code.
* Familiarize myself with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which allows me to access your data more easily.
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce graphs illustrating my results.

Through out this project i followed the following steps : 
1- I gathered my data from [Gapminder world](https://www.gapminder.org/data/)
